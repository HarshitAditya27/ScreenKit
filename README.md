## Introduction 🐱‍💻
- ScreenKit is a modern video sharing platform that allows users to upload, record, and share videos seamlessly—offering a YouTube-like experience with streamlined performance and enhanced features.
- ScreenKit utilizes <a href="https://bunny.net/"> Bunny.net </a> as its Content Delivery Network (CDN) to efficiently **host** and **stream** videos with minimal latency. Leveraging Bunny’s in-house AI capabilities, the platform can automatically generate subtitles for uploaded videos, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.
- For data management, ScreenKit uses <a href="https://xata.io/">Xata</a> as its primary database solution. It stores structured application data such as video metadata (including titles, descriptions, and thumbnails) as well as user profile details in a scalable and performant manner.
- ScreenKit is built using Next.js for the frontend framework, TypeScript for type-safe development, and Tailwind CSS for responsive and utility-first styling.
- ScreenKit offers a range of essential functionalities designed to enhance the user experience. Users can choose to set their videos as either public or private, giving them control over their content's visibility. The platform supports real-time updates to video view counts, reflecting engagement as it happens. Each user has a dedicated profile that showcases their uploaded videos and personal details. ScreenKit also enables easy sharing of content by generating shareable links that can be copied directly to the clipboard. Additionally, users have the flexibility to either upload pre-recorded videos or record new ones directly within the application.
